# PoS_Tagger
In corpus linguistics, a Part-of-Speech (PoS) is a category of words which have similar grammatical properties as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc. Part-of-Speech tagging, which can be considered as a multi-class classification problem, is the process of determining the syntactic category (PoS) of a word from the words in its surrounding context.
